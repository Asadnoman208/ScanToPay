**Project Status Summary

**API Development:
---The majority of the APIs have been successfully implemented.
---Some sections have been left incomplete due to repetition of similar logic across different modules. These can be easily extended using existing code patterns.
---A few pieces of working code have been temporarily commented out for testing purposes. The core concepts and logic are fully implemented and can be thoroughly tested by uncommenting these sections (e.g., 
  tokenization, email verification).

**Testing:
---Unit and integration tests have been written using Jest for one of the modules. Similar test cases can be applied to the other modules, as the logic is consistent across them.
---Postman collection for API testing is attached. The tokenization feature is implemented and can be tested by setting the token in the header of each API request.

**Documentation:
---The database schema diagram is attached for reference.
---All implemented features have been documented, and I am available to discuss any specific points or questions you may have.

Please feel free to reach out if you need any further clarifications or have additional points you'd like to discuss.
